# Annotation - Standard Protocol (First Half)
## Medical Data Annotator Group Track, Session A

Now, you will annotate 40 images using the **standard protocol**. In this method, simply annotate
a single boundary around the relevant node. 

## [1] Setting up the Annotation Interface

Please follow the following steps to prepare for annotation.

1. Open the [annotation interface](https://mua.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} (opens in new tab).

7. You will keep on annotating until you hit the end of your range (you will see a black image with white text on it indicating the range has ended).

## [2] Preparing to Time Yourself

The time will be projected on the board. You will have been given a physical time recording sheet. When you begin annotating, record the current time (minutes and seconds). After you finish annotating an image, record the current time (minutes and seconds) and move on to the next image as soon as you can.

## [3] The Annotation Interface

The annotation interface is simple.

Feel free to refer back to these examples.

## [5] Start Annotating

You may now begin annotating your range. Please ask your session lead if you have any questions or difficulties. You should take at most 30 to 40 seconds for each image, although you may be slower at first as you are acquainting yourself with the annotation interface.
