# Annotation - Min/Max Protocol
**Second Half**

**Medical Data Track, Session A**

Now, you will annotate 40 images using the **min/max protocol**. In this method, you will draw
a 'min' region and a 'max' region. The 'min' annotation represents the region you are very sure should
be annotated. The 'max' annotation is less strict, and includes all regions which could possibly be
annotated. It follows that any regions outside of the 'max' annotation are very likely not to be annotated.

This protocol allows you to represent uncertainty directly in the annotations. For instance, if part of an
object is blurred or darkened, making it difficult to classify either as part of or not part of the annotation,
you can exclude it from the min region but include it in the max region.

## [1] Setting up the Annotation Interface
Please locate your assigned image range for **min/max** annotation. The annotation assignments are [here](https://andre-ye.github.io/muadocs/annot_assigns/med){:target="_blank"}. For instance, suppose that you are annotator ID #4. Your assigned image range for standard annotation is 376 - 415.

## [2] Preparing to Time Yourself

The time will be projected on the board. You will have been given a physical time recording sheet. When you begin annotating, record the current time (minutes and seconds). After you finish annotating an image, record the current time (minutes and seconds) and move on to the next image as soon as you can.

## [3] Annotating with the Min/Max Protocol

The annotation interface is designed to be simple. To begin, click on `Annotate` > `Poly`. This will automatically set you up to draw a polygon. Move your cursor over the image, and click where you want to make a vertex. When you are finished, right-click. **This connects your most recently drawn vertex to the first vertex**, enclosing a polygon.

If you are unhappy with an annotation, you can delete it. Make sure that the appropriate annotation is selected (it should have red borders). If you created it recently, it may already be selected. You can select an annotation by first pressing `Pick`, then clicking on the desired regions. Then, click on the red trash can button.

A more convenient way to draw polygons is to 'free-draw', in which you can freely move your mouse to define a curved region. To do this, click on `Annotate` > `Poly`, but **hold shift and click while you move your mouse** around the desired region. When you are finished, right-click. This will similarly connect the most recently drawn point to the first vertex, enclosing the polygon.

Rather than deleting annotations, you can also add and subtract regions to edit an existing annotation.

For the duration of these images, do not touch the `Save Min` button.

## [4] Examples

Feel free to refer back to these examples.

## [5] Start Annotating

You may now begin annotating your range. Please ask your session lead if you have any questions or difficulties. You should take at most 30 to 40 seconds for each image, although you may be slower at first as you are acquainting yourself with the annotation interface.

## [6] Experience Survey
After you are finished annotating, please fill out this quick second-half [experience form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFyTy7SCcg1BDDRsAVXJ0C7zMnOPzh0B-GfdAvLCDO_Yr6sQ/viewform?usp=sf_link){:target="_blank"}.

## [7] Finished?

Your participation session is complete! ðŸ¥³ Thanks for participating in this study. Check in with your session lead before leaving. Expect to receive a gift card soon.
